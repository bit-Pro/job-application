# Assignment 1: Written and Oral

### Objective: 
To demonstrate effective job application skills and to demonstrate communication skills appropriate to the IT industry.

### Background: 
You need to be able to communicate, both in verbal and written form, in order to give people a good impression of you. This may begin at a job application but does not end there. Even if you perform badly in an interview but have the skills required, you might be hired and have a chance to improve your standing with communication thereafter.

## Instructions:

-	The aim is to use your communication skills to the best of your ability, beginning with a job application and interview, to give an employer confidence that you are worth employing.
-	If you perform very well in an interview, you may not have to work too hard after that to maintain this confidence.
-	If you underperform in an interview you will have to work hard to regain the employerâ€™s confidence in you.

*Apply for one of the jobs offered in the first week of the course. *

This will include submitting a CV and cover letter and undergoing a job interview.
You will be judged on your ability to follow the job application process and on your ability to communicate clearly and professionally.
